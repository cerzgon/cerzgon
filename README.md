Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I recently completed a secure software development program that equipped me with the skills and knowledge to develop robust and reliable software. As a developer, I'm passionate about building elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems and constantly exploring new technologies and tools to improve my craft.

My GitHub profile features a range of projects that showcase my expertise with different stacks and programming languages. For instance, I've built a full-stack application using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This project highlights my proficiency in developing web applications using modern frameworks and libraries. The project features a work ticketing system that allows users to perform CRUD operations.

In addition, I've completed a project using the MEN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js. This project demonstrates my proficiency in building back-end systems and APIs that integrate with databases.

I've also started to add some JavaScript projects to my profile that demonstrate my understanding of the language and its various frameworks and libraries. Recently, I completed a quote generator that accesses an API and provides users with the ability to tweet a quote to their followers.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!
